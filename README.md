## Front End With GraphQL and Apollo!

## Note: 
 - The project that was generated by create-react-app uses semicolons and double quotes for strings.   All the code that youâ€™re going to add will use no semicolons and mostly single quotes. Youâ€™re       also free to delete any existing semicolons and replace double with single quotes ðŸ”¥

## Before we start the server, letâ€™s quickly understand the main components:
 - prisma: This directory holds all the files that relate to your Prisma setup. The Prisma client is used to access the database in your GraphQL resolvers (similar to an ORM).

 - prisma.yml is the root configuration file for your Prisma project.
datamodel.prisma defines your data model in the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL). When using Prisma, the datamodel is used to describe the database schema.
src: This directory holds the source files for your GraphQL server.

 - schema.graphql contains your application schema. The application schema defines the GraphQL operations you can send from the frontend. Weâ€™ll take a closer look at this file in just a bit.
generated/prisma-client contains the auto-generated Prisma client, a type-safe database access library (similar to an ORM).
resolvers contains the resolver functions for the operations defined in the application schema.
index.js is the entry point for your GraphQL server.
